        Browser extensions are small pieces of code that make your web browsing experience more fun, more useful, more private or more public.

        ![](framework/img/workshop/extensionExamples.png)

        They usually show themselves as buttons in the top bar of your web browser and allow some extra functionality that doesn't come with your browser by default.

        #Today

        Today we're going to build something in the fun category of browser extensions: We're going to look at how web pages are built, then look at how we can change them.

        The internet needs more cats! So we're going to build an extension that will replace every image on the page with kittens (or the animal of your choosing). It should look a little like this: <!-- .element: class="delayed" -->

        #What is code, though?

        What we generally call "code" is just a set of instructions that tell a computer what to do. Code is a series of commands, that the computer knows how to execute. <!-- .element: class="delayed" -->

        There are many different languages under the umbrella of "code" but they all follow very similar concepts and are built for particular tasks. <!-- .element: class="delayed" -->

        In our case, we're writing JavaScript, which is the common language of web browsers. When we write programs for the Web, we generally write them in JavaScript. <!-- .element: class="delayed" -->

        Note that when you add an unpacked extension to your Chrome, you have to select the WHOLE folder, not just a file inside of it.

        When you add a new unpacked extension, Chrome looks for the manifest file to see what's inside and what it should do next.

        The basics of a browser extension are pretty straight forward. All we have to kick things off are a folder of images, and a file called manifest.json.

        ## In the error

        * Line number it's on

          * Set the title and description, icons and all of those fancy details.
          * Ask for special permissions to control web pages.

          You have a basic manifest file in your exercises folder already. You can open that and see what's inside now.

        #A button

        The biggest thing about browser extensions that most people are familiar with is they come with a button.

        Buttons trigger actions.

        Buttons are defined in the manifest. It looks a little like this:

        ```javascript
"page_action": {
    "default_icon": {
      "16": "images/get_started16.png",
      "32": "images/get_started32.png",
      "48": "images/get_started48.png",
      "128": "images/get_started128.png"
    }
}

        ![](framework/img/workshop/pressbutton.gif)

        Buttons are really fun. We should make our button do something.
      </script>
    </section>

    <section class="slide" data-markdown>
      <script type="text/template">
        # First we need permission

        * Permissions are a big part of writing extensions.
        * Permissions also live in the manifest file.

        ```javascript
        "permissions": ["activeTab", "declarativeContent"],
        ```

        * Declarative Content is the permission needed to activate the button and actually allow it to do something in the browser.<!-- .element: class="delayed" -->
        * Active Tab gives our extension permission to access the current tab and interact with it.<!-- .element: class="delayed" -->
        * We voluntarily limit what our script can do to keep our script simple.<!-- .element: class="delayed" -->

      </script>
    </section>


    <section class="slide" data-markdown>
      <script type="text/template">
        #Next: A script!

        * A script is the list of commands that will run in your browser when you click the button.
        * The manifest can point to them so everything ties together very cleanly.

        Referencing a script file looks something like this:

        ```javascript
        "background": {
          "scripts": ["script.js"],
          "persistent": false
        }

    </section>

    <section class="slide nested-list" data-markdown>
      <script type="text/template">
        #The script

        We added a reference to something called script.js in our manifest file.  This file sets up how your extension works.  It's called **scaffolding**.


      </script>
    </section>


      <section class="slide" data-markdown>
          <script type="text/template">
              #All three files

              ##Manifest --> script.js --> main.js

              1. The manifest tells the browser to listen to what script.js tells it to do.

              2. Script.js tells the browser to activate the extension button, but not do anything until the button is pressed. When the button is pressed, run anything that's in main.js.

              3. Main.js tells the current page you're on to turn green.

              With a lot of code, we end up doing a lot of setup work to make our actual construction work a lot easier. This is one of those situations.

              Up until now we've been setting up our extension to:

              * exist in our extensions with our own title and description<!-- .element: class="delayed" -->
              * have permission to identify and manage our tabs<!-- .element: class="delayed" -->
              * have a button with our logo of choice on it<!-- .element: class="delayed" -->
              * run a script file of our choosing when someone clicks that button   <!-- .element: class="delayed" -->

              All of those steps until now have allowed us to run one line of JavaScript on the page loaded into our tab:

              ```javascript
              document.body.style.backgroundColor = "green";
              ```

        But this is just one way to edit these pages.

        * CSS: this is how everything looks. It's the style, the appearance, the design.<!-- .element: class="delayed" -->
        * JavaScript: this is the personality of the web page, how it behaves, how it responds to user inputs.<!-- .element: class="delayed" -->

        #The basic idea of HTML

        HTML is written in tags.

        Tags usually come in pairs &mdash; an opening tag and a closing tag &mdash; to *wrap* the content.  Note the closing tag has a forward slash (`/`).

        ```
        <tag> opening tag --- closing tag </tag>
        ```

        HTML tags describe the content inside of them to the web browser.<!-- .element: class="delayed" -->
        ```
        <h1>This tag describes a heading</h1>
        <p>This tag is for paragraphs.</p>
        ```

    </section>

    <section class="slide" data-markdown>

        Tags can be *nested* within other tags like this:

        ```
        <outertag>outer content <innertag>inner content</innertag> outer content</outertag>
        ```

        - Nested tags create a tree-like relationship
        - Referred to as *parent* and *child* nodes.

        The inner tag is the child of the outer tag.<!-- .element: class="delayed" -->

        ```
        <parent>
          <child></child>

        ```

        Refresh your extension and give it a shot.

        # JavaScript is a Programming Language

        Because JavaScript is a programming language, the structure and syntax include more complexities than HTML or CSS.

        The basic building blocks of programming include features such as *variables*, *functions*, *objects* or control structures such as *if* statements or *loops*.

        # JavaScript variables

        Variables are a thing in almost all programming languages ever.

        They are kind of like containers, or a box.

        * used to *store* values
        * can be used any time, whenever you need them
        * gives a *name* to a *value*.

        A variable is a named memory location which contains information, to be used at a later time.

        For example, a variable could be used to store a customer's email address.  Then, the variable can be used to send a confirmation email.

        * end the command with a semi-colon (`;`)

        ```javascript
        var myVariable = "Hello!";
        ```

        The value `Hello` is given to the name `myVariable` and is declared using the keyword `var`. This is *assigning* a value to the *variable*.

        Evaluate everything to the right of the equals sign, then assign the value to the variable on the left of the equals sign.

        * Cannot contain spaces:
          * use camelCase for names with multiple words.
          * every new word is capitalized
          * the result looks kind of like `camelHumps`

        * Use a descriptive names:
        `var firstName;` ← Clear that first name will go here.

        # Variable Types: Strings

        When storing text values, like words or sentences, the variable type is a *string* value.

        var greeting = "Hello!";
        ```

        ```javascript

        You can open the console when viewing _any_ HTML page. In Chrome, there are different ways to open the Console tab.

        Keyboard shortcut:
        `COMMAND + OPTION + J` (MAC)  / `CONTROL + SHIFT + J` (WINDOWS)

        OR

        Select: `View > Developer > JavaScript Console`.

        Open the console in this slide presentation. Take a moment to practice opening and closing the console until you’re comfortable with it.

        ###Pro tip!
        The console also shows any errors on the page so if you open the console on any existing web page, you *may* see some error messages.

        # Images

        Images are so much fun. In the wild world of HTML, images look like this:

        ```
        <img src="http://placekitten.com/100/100">
        ```

        Unlike a lot of tags, ```img``` tags don't have a closing ```</img>``` at their close.

        That little src= is the source attribute, linking the image tag to the actual image file.

        Conveniently enough, it's called setAttribute. Here's an example:

        ```javascript
        image.setAttribute('src', 'http://placekitten.com/200/300')

        # Loops

        Humans are really bad at repetitive tasks.

        Computers are good at boring repetitive things! We call them loops.

        We can take a whole list of things (like a list of images) and then run the same bit of code on each item.

        Loops become very powerful very quickly.

        We can loop through all of the images on the page

        That loop looks a bit like this:
        ```javascript
for (var i = 0; i < allImages.length; i++) {
  console.log(allImages[i]);
}
        ```

        Let's break that down:

        * allImages is a variable that contains a list of all the images on the page.
        * i is a variable that tracks which of the images in the list we're currently working with. It's a number that walks up the list of images with us, starting at 0.
        * So i starts at 0, goes until it's reached the length of all the images, increasing by one every time.
        * At each image, it console.logs that image.

        ```

        That will take the src attribute of the image and replace whatever is currently there with a placekitten link.

        The placeholder image links have a /200/300 in them. Those are the width and height.

        Instead of using the same 200x300 image for every image on our page, we can use the appropriately sized image each time.

        To do this, we need to detect how big the original image in that spot was.

        ```javascript
var imageHeight = allImages[i].clientHeight;
var imageWidth = allImages[i].clientWidth;
        ```
        Those two lines create two new variables, and use the clientHeight and clientWidth attributes to store how big the original images are.

    </section>

    <section class="slide" data-markdown>
      <script type="text/template">

allImages[i].setAttribute('src', 'https://placekitten.com/' + imageWidth + '/' + imageHeight)

  var imageHeight = allImages[i].clientHeight;

        #Event listeners

        Events are very common in web development. Events are how a web browser interprets what happens when someone clicks their mouse, or scrolls down the page, or finishes loading a page, or hovers over an image on a page. There are literally hundreds of events firing from your web browser every second.

        Event *listeners* are small pieces of code that pay attention to those events.

        Event listeners can be very powerful.

    </section>

    <section class="slide" data-markdown>
      <script type="text/template">
        #Event listeners

        Event listeners are generally attached to elements that are already on your page.

        That way you can say "hey, image, when someone clicks on you, this is how you should behave."


      </script>
    </section>

    <section class="slide" data-markdown>
      <script type="text/template">
        #Event listeners

        Remember that ```allImages[i]``` means this particular image in our loop.

        So instead of updating it immediately with our new picture, we can tell it to wait until someone clicks on it.

        ```javascript
        allImages[i].addEventListener('click', function() {
          console.log(this)
        })
        ```

        Let's go over each part:

        - ```allImages[i]``` is the particular image on the page.
        - ```addEventListener``` is telling that image to pay attention to an event
        - ```'click'``` tells it what event to pay attention to. It's going to wait for someone to click on it.
        - ```function() {}``` is what happens when someone does click on it. The code to execute when someone clicks on that image goes in between the curly braces.

      </script>
    </section>

    <section class="slide" data-markdown>
      <script type="text/template">
        #Wait - what's THIS

        ```javascript
          console.log(this)
        ```

        That's weird.

        The word ```this``` just refers to the item you just clicked on. What did you just click on? This. I just clicked on this: I'm going to console.log() it.

        It's weird to just have one word "this" but it's actually a very powerful tool in our tool box.

      </script>
    </section>

    <section class="slide" data-markdown>
      <script type="text/template">
        #Event listeners

        The code right now should look like this:

        ```javascript
        for (var i = 0; i < allImages.length; i++) {
            allImages[i].addEventListener('click', function() {
            console.log(this)
          })
        }
        ```

        Since we have ```this``` we can also act on it just as we did with our previous exercise.

        ```
        var thisImageHeight = this.clientHeight;
        var thisImageWidth = this.clientWidth;
        var imageLink = "https://placekitten.com/" + thisImageWidth + "/" + thisImageHeight;
        this.setAttribute('src', imageLink);
        ```

      </script>
    </section>

    <section class="slide" data-markdown>
      <script type="text/template">
        #Stretch goal the first

        All together now, your click-to-replace-image code will be:

        ```javascript
        for (var i = 0; i < allImages.length; i++) {
          allImages[i].addEventListener('click', function() {
            var thisImageHeight = this.clientHeight;
            var thisImageWidth = this.clientWidth;
            var imageLink = "http://placekitten.com/" + thisImageWidth + "/" + thisImageHeight;
            this.setAttribute('src', imageLink);
          })
        }
        ```

        this.remove()
        ```

        Boom. Done. Gone.

        We learned a whole pile of things:

        * the basics of how to install and trigger browser extensions
        * what javascript looks like and how to customize it
        * HTML attributes
        * placeholder images!
        * some of the ethics around running your code on other people's computers

        <p>We can also use what we've learned today to create something fun, like this: <a href="http://nthitz.github.io/turndownforwhatjs/">Turn Down For What</a>, or somthing helpful, like this: <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/zoom-text-only/jamhfhbppcmkgghlkeieococonlbppjg">Zoom Text Only</a></p><!-- .element: class="delayed" -->
